Iconic killstreak from MW now in V!

Features:
<li>Use a flare to mark your target
<li>Two jets will spawn and BRRRTTT marked target
<li>Sound from Insurgency Sandstorm and youtube videos, remixed and tweaked by me
<li>Radio chatter from [PROTOTYPE], cut by me (few variations, to not get boring too quickly)
<li>Toggle jet camera by pressing NumPad5 (configurable via .ini)
<li>Addon planes supported (just change "lazer" to the spawn name of your added plane in the .ini)
<li>Configurable via .ini

I recommend to use it with the <a href=https://www.gta5-mods.com/vehicles/a-10-warthog-thunderbolt-usa-airforce-addon-fivem>A10</a>, to be true to the original.
Install it, and change model from "lazer" to "warthog" in the .ini file that comes with the script. Of course you can use any other plane you'd like.

<li>1.3.1
<br>-Remixed the sound, more bass and cleaned some noise
<br>-Added bassy distant jet sound, sound doesn't cut off abruptly

<li>1.3.2
<br>-Fixed planes disappearing too early in some cases

<li>1.4
<br>-Fixed camera toggle responsiveness
<br>-Fixed planes exploding on spawn
<br>-Fixed planes not firing at the target (the only case they won't fire is when the flare stopped smoking, since the pilots can't see the target anymore they RTB)
<br>-Fixed planes exploding from their own shots
<br>-Fixed planes crashing into things
<br>-Pilots use brakes and other surfaces (make turns), flight feels more natural
<br>-Planes have turbulence now
<br>-Planes now spawn smarter, and always head in the correct direction
<br>-Fixed gear retracting/detracting mid flight
<br>-Planes now use the height of the target as an offset (if you throw a flare on the top of Chiliad, the planes will spawn at the height of the mountain plus the height you specified in the ini)
<br>-The strike covers larger area now, the coverage area moves forward with the plane
<br>-Added ability to tweak the radius of the strike via ini (if radius set to zero, the shots will draw a straight line)
<br>-Added ability to toggle blips via ini

<li>2.0
<br>-New targeting mode - you can switch between flare and the IR Spotlight marker in the menu. Different strikes, different spotlight colors

<br>-Menu adjustments
<br>-Added effects on radar when planes spawn/despawn
<br>-Incase of incorrect model name in the ini you will see a warning message, instead of crashing
