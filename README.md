Iconic killstreak from MW now in V!

Features:
<li>Use a flare to mark your target
<li>Two jets will spawn and BRRRTTT marked target
<li>BRT from Insurgency Sandstorm
<li>Radio chatter from [PROTOTYPE], cut and edited by me (few variations, to not get boring too quickly)
<li>Toggle jet camera by pressing NumPad5 (configurable via .ini)
<li>Addon planes supported (just change "lazer" to the spawn name of your added plane in the .ini)
<li>Configurable via .ini

I recommend to use it with the <a href=https://www.gta5-mods.com/vehicles/a-10-warthog-thunderbolt-usa-airforce-addon-fivem>A10</a>, to be true to the original.
Install it, and change model from "lazer" to "warthog" in the .ini file that comes with the script. Of course you can use any other plane you'd like.
